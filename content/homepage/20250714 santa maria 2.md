Breakfast this morning in our B&B -- cap (8/10, but mainly because I was sitting in our host's beautiful kitchen), more black bread, prosciutto, and homemade strudel.

Luca took us on a walking tour of Santa Maria, showing us all the sights of his (and by extension, Erika's) family. The original Giorgis home is right around the corner from where Elena lives, but the owner is no longer a Giorgis and also not friendly enough to try and see inside.

Today was market day in Santa Maria, so we walked through it to get a taste of the local life, and Erika was able to load up on airplane candy.

Then began our driving tour of the valley, which started by driving the eastern-most end and into Switzerland. I need to check with the regulators on whether that counts as a new country, but I feel it's worth pointing out that it counts far more than our layover in Zurich tomorrow would. 

It's worth mentioning that the roads through the valley are exactly what you'd expect in the Alps -- tight and twisty. Luca is an exceedingly good driver, and his car is not too big, but it still will get you dizzy as a passenger.

Quick stop in Malesco to see its beautiful waterfall.

We picked up Elena to go to lunch in Toceno (which *technically* is the town where Elena's house is, but nobody is really sure why). Lunch was Le Vie del Borgo, a beautiful little 1-star where we all did the prix fixe lunch menu. 

Bear with me while I try to describe the courses. Started with a taster board that had a little Argentinian empanada, a cream-cheese beet tart, fried zuchinni flower with some green sauce, and what I can only describe as a gazpacho sorbet. The antipasti was a zucchini flower stuffed with a creamed-olive kinda thing in a tomato sauce with basil oil and olive. First course was ricotta-stuffed ravioli with a zucchini sauce and red shrimp. The main course was a lightly seared local steak with the perfect amount of mashed potatoes and vegetables. Dessert was a kind of shortbread cookie topped with a vanilla mousse, a really light lemon cookie, and then a scoop of chocolate gelato, surrounded by droplets of a ginger sauce. 

It was incredibly good. I'm now thinking that I'll do a post-trip wrap-up that includes a power-ranking of our meals. This one will be near the top. 

After dropping Elena back off we continued our tour by driving up the north side of the valley where we walked out to an old stone bridge, across from which Luca's father (and many others even today) would start off their hikes through the mountains, either up to Switzerland or back down to Domodossola. 

Then back down to Toceno, where we saw a building containing a xylotheque that Luca's father helped put together containing many different species of wood. We also kinda crashed a funeral for a local Giorgis (no relation, his first name is Giorgis).

    alt = "Stone buidlings flank the tight street that Erika and Luca walk through."

We then drove up to Albogno, the highest town in the valley, to take in the spectacular views and to see some of the historic homes there too. 

We had an hour and a half back at the AirBnb to catch out breath, and then back over to Elena's for dinner. 

I'll be honest, and I'm ashamed to admit it, when Luca told me dinner would likely be "cold rice," I was hesitant. We had a starter of raw veggies (yes, I ate raw veggies) dipped in an olive oil/vinegar/salt mixture, that kicked off the health train. And then the cold rice, which is very adjacent to pasta salad, with raw peppers/onions, feta, and tuna all mixed together with a dressing of olive oil and white vinegar. It's exactly the fuel both of us needed before a big day of travel tomorrow. 

I feel like I'm forgetting 50% of the day, but consider that the highlights. I'm also just about crashed out at this point. Enjoying every minute, but running on fumes. Tomorrow is going to be a marathon travel day, but the end holds our comfy bed. I'll be racing there.
