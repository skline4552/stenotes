Another big travel day, another day of sprinting through Milano Centrale. 

Started off in Il Borgo with a really sweetly packed up breakfast, which they had prepared because we'd be leaving too early for their traditional breakfast. A quick taxi ride got us back up to Reggio Emilia for our train to Milan. 

The conductor on that train informed us that our whole travel plan for the day wasn't going to work, and gave us some direction that ended up being wrong due to a line closure. Eventually, we got to Arona, where we could catch a bus to Domodossola.

There we met with Luca, Erika's dad's second cousin, who is hosting us along with his mother, Elena, for our stay here in Santa Maria Maggiore. He started us off by walking us around the old town of Domodossola, which is both centuries-old and charming.

We then drove into the Valle Vigezzo to Santa Maria Maggiore, where Elena lives. The last time Elena and Erika were together was before Erika had even turned one, so it was beautiful to see them united. Elena invited us into her home for the perfect snack of coffee, beer, salami, and focaccia. Erika, Luca, and Elena shared memories of other family members' trips to visit Santa Maria Maggiore, including Steve's, which were especially fascinating to hear about.

Luca then took us to our B&B so we could relax and clean up before dinner.

And did we have dinner. 

Elena and Luca prepared an authentic taste of what homemade Italian food can be. We started with the mortadella, prosciutto, whipped tuna/prosciutto spreads, local black bread, and all the accoutrements to go with. The main course was a Valle Vigezzo classic -- pasta with four cheeses, potatoes, onions, and bacon. Then homemade tiramisu for dessert. 

I ate more food than I have in a long time. It would have been rude not to. 

After dinner we shared travel horror stories, of which Elena had plenty. But some really interesting good stories too. 

Luca then took us on a night-time stroll of Santa Maria. It served as a taste of what tomorrow will bring, and a great opportunity to move around a bit post-dinner.

Tomorrow we tour more of the valley, and maybe even drive the 10km up to Switzerland so we can claim another country.
