## It's almost go time
It's a Lise Kline tradition to have a [travel blog](https://www.legskline.com/) that captures the memories of a trip that might otherwise get lost to the nether. I wanted to carry that tradition on with the travels that Erika and I undertake. Welcome to Stephen's Notes. 

I can't promise that I'll deliver as refined of product as my mother -- in fact I'm quite certain that many blog entries will simply be a list of the restaurants we went to, what we ate, and maybe the touristy stuff we saw. Hopefully with some quality pictures of Erika to accompany the short sentences. But the people still love that kind of stuff, and who am I to keep the people from what they want? 

We're around three weeks out from our Europe trip, so I wanted to pull together a teaser of where we'll be, what we're hoping to see, and some of the food/activities we already have lined up. It's worth noting that we have purposefully not booked out every day. Most days are still quite blank. Our goal is to live in the moment and try and let our taste guide us to what we need to experience. 

## So where are y'all going? 
13 days on the road. Five cities. Here's a breakdown of what we've got.

### Paris
We land at de Gaulle on July 3rd, and we're staying in the third arrondissement. Set plans are minimal in Paris -- we know we want to do *some* of the traditional touristy things like eat a baguette and drink a bottle of wine under the Eiffel tower, walk down the Champs-Élysées, attend an art gallery (probably the Musée d'Orsay). 

The one thing that is absolutely certain is that Erika will be crushing a fully-gluten croissant at the first reputable bakery we come across. If the rumors are true and she can do gluten in Europe, then there will be a lot of gluten on this trip.

No matter how that gluten experiment plays out, much of our time in Paris will be spent eating. Between recs from friends, my travel blog reading, and Erika's TikTok research, we've accumulated a wide list of places to check out.

### Lyon
On the 7th we train to Lyon, arriving around mid-day. I think I first learned about Lyon in Bill Buford's "Dirt", which means I was mildly disappointed to learn that Bocuse's establishments aren't what they once were, but that's largely okay because we're only there for one night, and that one night is a Monday, and most everything is closed on Mondays anyways. 

I did manage to find a two-star that's open that evening, La Mère Brazier, so that's where we'll do dinner.

Hopefully we won't get too full from lunch.

### Florence
The next day, after our last French croissant for the trip, we're back on the train. This time we'll be traveling across the Alps to Florence. 

If you know anything about me, you know that YouTube is usually playing something on the TV when I'm around it. During the winter time one of my favorite background videos is trains crossing through the snowy Alps. Stunning views, clickety clack of the train as it rolls down the track, the occasional air horn, it's incredibly relaxing. To experience it in real life is extremely exciting, even if there is significantly less snow. 

We'll again hit the touristy standards for Florence -- we've got tickets to climb the Duomo, to see David (two sets of tickets for David, couldn't be sure about timing), and we'll walk across the Ponte Vecchio. More art museums, more random cafes, more little shops so Erika can find the perfect little leather purse. 

Recs for food are again copious, and I'm hoping that we'll find just as many more new spots naturally. We're staying in Sant'Ambrogio, which is maybe slightly off the beaten path, but still only a 10 minute walk to the Duomo. But our AirBnb looks *extremely* Florentine, it's described as an "artist's loft", and the neighborhood hosts Florence's oldest covered food market and oldest barber. If we don't get a pure Firenze experience there, I don't know where we will. 

### Reggio Emilia
Now the trip starts to slow down. I think my feet will be thanking me. 

On the 11th we head to [Il Borgo Del Balsamico](https://www.ilborgodelbalsamico.it/en/), which is a villa turned B&B and balsamic vinegar seller and is consequently where Erika and I will learn that the balsamic vinegar we get in the states is mostly garbage. 

I imagine that most of our time for the next two days will be spent lounging around the pool, possibly going into Reggio Emilia to see what it has to offer.

### Santa Maria Maggiore
On the 13th we head north, this time about as far north as you can get into Italy without getting to Switzerland. 

Steve's extended family still lives in Santa Maria Maggiore and sound enthusiastic to host us for a couple nights. I'm pumped to fully dive into small-town Italy. 

On the 15th we'll drive back down, hop a flight from Milan to Zurich, and then on to Dulles. Then I get to drive back down 95, probably during rush hour. That's a welcome home if I've ever heard of one. 


## But first, the beach
We're headed to the OBX with Erika's family on Sunday. There will be a post about that trip before we leave for Europe, but not the daily update I'm hoping to do in Europe. 

Until then, I'll be practicing my nonexistant Italian, Erika will be researching gluten-free gelato spots (just in case), and we'll both be counting down the days. À bientôt!
