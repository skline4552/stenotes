## It's almost go time
It's a Lise Kline tradition to have a [travel blog](https://www.legskline.com/) that captures the memories of a trip that might otherwise get lost to the nether. I wanted to carry that tradition on with the travels that Erika and I undertake. Welcome to Stephen's Notes. 

I can't promise that I'll deliver as refined of product as my mother -- in fact I'm quite certian that many blog entries will simply be a list of the resturaunts we went to, what we ate, and maybe the touristy stuff we saw. Hopefully with some quality pictures of Erika to accompany the short sentences. But the people still love that kind of stuff, and who am I to keep the people from what they want? 

We're around three weeks out from our Europe trip, so I wanted to pull together a teaser of where we'll be, what we're hoping to see, and some of the food/activities we already have lined up. It's worth noting that we have purposefully not booked out every day. Most days are still quite blank. Our goal is to live in the moment and try and let out taste guide us to what we need to experience. 

## So where are y'all going? 
13 days on the road. Five cities. Here's a breakdown of what we've got.

### Paris


### Lyon


### Florence


### Santa Maria Maggiore
