## It's almost go time
It's a Lise Kline tradition to have a [travel blog](https://www.legskline.com/) that captures the memories of a trip that might otherwise get lost to the nether. I wanted to carry that tradition on with the travels that Erika and I undertake. Welcome to Stephen's Notes. 

I can't promise that I'll deliver as refined of product as my mother -- in fact I'm quite certian that many blog entries will simply be a list of the resturaunts we went to, what we ate, and maybe the touristy stuff we saw. Hopefully with some quality pictures of Erika to accompany the short sentences. But the people still love that kind of stuff, and who am I to keep the people from what they want? 

We're around three weeks out from our Europe trip, so I wanted to pull together a teaser of where we'll be, what we're hoping to see, and some of the food/activities we already have lined up. It's worth noting that we have purposefully not booked out every day. Most days are still quite blank. Our goal is to live in the moment and try and let out taste guide us to what we need to experience. 

## So where are y'all going? 
13 days on the road. Five cities. Here's a breakdown of what we've got.

### Paris
We land at de Gaulle on July 3rd, and we're staying in the third arrondissement. Set plans are minimal in Paris -- we know we want to do *some* of the traditional touristy things like eat a baquette and drink a bottle of wine under the Eiffel tower, walk down the Champs-Élysées, attend an art gallery (probably the Musée d'Orsay). 

The one thing that is absolutely certian is that Erika will be crushing a fully-gluten crossaint at the first reputable bakery we come across. If the rumors are true and she can do gluten in Europe, then there will be a lot of gluten on this trip.

No matter how that gluten experiment plays out, much of our time in Paris will be spent eating. Between rec's from friends, my travel blog reading, and Erika's TikTok research, we've accumulated a wide list of places to check out.

### Lyon
On the 7th we train to Lyon, arriving around mid-day. I think I first learned about Lyon in Bill Buford's "Dirt", which means I was mildly disappointed to learn that Bocuse's establishments aren't what they once were, but that's largely okay because we're only there for one night, and that one night is a Monday, and most everything is closed on Mondays anyways. 

I did manage to find a two-star that's open that evening, La Mère Brazier, so that's where we'll do dinner.

Hopefully we won't get too full from lunch.

### Florence
After crushing another French croissant, we'll again head to the 

### Santa Maria Maggiore
