Assign roles to prompts. Don't make them specific. It can help frame the question.
 
It's possible to create a structure to how the AI responds using tags.
 
Tell the AI how to think through the process, enter its results into a <scratchpad>, and double-check its response to try and eliminate hallucinations.
 
Optimal placement context
- Role or responsibility (usually brief)
- Context/document
- Specific instructions
- Prefilled response
 
Temperature adjustments (usually on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0) control the 'creativity' of the AI. Lower numbers are more factual, higher numbers more creative and unpredictable. 0.8 is a good starting place for most work. Lower 
it for analytical use, raise it for strategic use.
